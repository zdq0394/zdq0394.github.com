# Cert Manager
## 概述
`cert-manager` is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as `Let’s Encrypt`, `HashiCorp Vault`, `Venafi`, `a simple signing key pair`, or `self signed`.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.
